            <div class="about-me__body">
                <p>To put it simply, I am an independent artist, content creator, and designer based in Oklahoma using the alias Xyla Bones. I attended Oklahoma State University and received a Bachelor's degree in architectural engineering. I have worked as an artist part time since I was sixteen, but I am now in full pursuit of an artistic and creative career in multiple mediums.</p>
                <p>I have a youtube channel, a tiktok, and an instagram where I share my creations, my pursuit of knowledge, and entertain my audience. I also sell my creations online and at  craft shows and festivals when I can. I also take commissions regularly in many of these mediums.</p>
                <p>If you have a business inquiry, please contact me by direct message on instagram or email (links in footer).</p>
                <br/>
                <p>The following post is a memoir about my recent life history and what made me who I am today. A bit of a blog post, if you will. Should you choose to read it, I hope you find something to relate to.</p>
                <div class="about-me__accordion">
                    <button type="button" class="about-me__accordion__button">Read My Story</button>
                    <div class="about-me__accordion__content">
                        <p>I grew up alongside three siblings and my parents in a small town in Oklahoma. I always felt I was a little different from my peers, but not enough to be a total stranger. My personality has always been eccentric, passionate, inquisitive, and free-spirited. Very early on, I showed creative potential and loved arts and crafts. I wanted to try everything as a kid, but my primary extracurriculars were visual arts, dance, and music. I attended Oklahoma State University and after five years of struggle and self-discovery, I received a bachelor's degree in architectural engineering. It still baffles me to this day that I was capable of such a feat, especially when comparing myself to my classmates. My degree taught me many, many things, but at the very least I learned how to be happy and proud of myself. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The next part of my story will be more detailed. Each phase has been an important stepping stone to my self-actualization. I feel it's important to share the life lessons that have contributed to my current values. These lessons influence my choices, they inspire my work, and they have led me to this path. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I started my career in one of the big cities, believing inner peace would come once I figured out the nine-to-five rhythm and found my niche as an engineer, only to discover I felt like I was living someone else's life and failing at it. My coworkers were, and still are, some of the most lovely people I have ever known, but the work itself made me feel like I was slowly being crushed to death, only I wasn't allowed to scream from the pain. My long-distance boyfriend invited me to move in with him so I could quit my job and start over as an artist while he supported me. This was a once-in-a-life-time opportunity, so I packed up my apartment and my cat, and I was off to Texas for the foreseeable future. 
                        </p>
                        <p>My pursuit of art was miserable in west Texas. I completely lacked a network, and I was still so ashamed of not being able to "make it" as an engineer, that even when I was able to complete the grueling work of copying a detailed photo to a canvas I still hated myself for not being efficient. I was overwhelmed with unknowns and still beat down from my previous work experience. I kept receiving mixed messages from friends and family about what I should do with my life, and most often the answer I got was "don't waste your degree," which only brought me more shame since I didn't feel as though I deserved it in the first place. 
                        </p>
                        <p>After a few months of flailing, I was desperate to prove I had any sort of value to anyone, mostly to myself. I looked for engineering jobs praying I wouldn't find any opportunities. The praying paid off and there were almost no entry level architectural engineering opportunities in the area at the time. I started looking for clerical work out of desperation. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I found out that someone from my highschool was a manager at a local branch of an appliance sales company, and they had a job opening. I was basically hired on the spot as an overqualified greeter (with a bunch of additional responsibilities that I was not paid for). I really gave it my best shot in the beginning, despite having absolutely no passion for the work. I slowly realized this was a dead end job. Any chance of moving up was determined by politics. Any time a superior acted like they were going to help me (or my coworkers) with work related resources, it never met expectations. Usually, we were barely better off than we were before, if not worse. They cut costs anywhere they could and tossed us scraps for going above and beyond. It's very hard to want to do a good job for people who don't want to do a good job for you. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Sidenote for anyone in this situation: You might need the company to give you work, but the company needs employees to do the work a lot more than the employees need work. Who's going to do the work if you don't? Ever seen Pixar's "A Bug's Life"? It has a wonderful message...
                        </p>
                        <p>Anyway, after this company offered me a lateral move that they pretended was a promotion, I started looking at coding bootcamps online to feel like I had potential again (they are all scams by the way, even the good ones). I had come to the conclusion that my entire existence in west Texas consisted of mental health issues, addiction, and meaninglessness. I was yet again, living someone else's life and failing miserably at it. And for what? It seemed like the only things that contributed to my growth during this time were my boyfriend who was patient enough to put up with me at my lowest; reuniting with my former college classmate who is now my bestfriend and my biggest cheerleader; my counselor who helped me greatly with my self-esteem, ADHD, relationships, and social anxiety; my psychiatrist who also helped me with my self-esteem, ADHD, and knew exactly who I was before I did (I can't thank this man enough for the value I got out of those sessions); and learning how to bleach and color my hair at home, which was honestly a breakthrough moment for my identity and my independence.
                        </p>
                        <p>I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge that taking care of your mental health can make or break your entire existence. You may be struggling more than you realize. It should not be normal for anyone to feel constantly miserable. It's not always affordable to see a professional, but there are many free online resources that can help with self-diagnosis and self-therapy. Seeking answers can be just as valuable as seeking help. Ask around. If it's safe to do so, tell someone you trust that you're struggling. Beware, the "self-help" industry does not qualify as therapy. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I needed a new opportunity. Out of the blue, my boyfriend informed me that he was getting transferred back to the big city I had come from. I was ecstatic. The new new new start I needed was coming. We packed up our stuff and now three cats and headed back to the city. We were getting settled into our new home and gaining our footing. It really felt like our lives were about to take off when suddenly a worldwide pandemic shut down everything. No one was hiring. Everything was cancelled. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The only thing that came my way was grocery delivery, and it wasn't half bad. The freedom was unbelievably satisfying. There was some correlation between the amount of effort and my paycheck, plus I felt like I was providing a service that people actually needed. I even got a few opportunities to help some people who really were in need, and the stories I got to tell made me the center of many conversations. However, according to the numbers, these services hardly pay their contractors fairly. Besides that, the shopper market was way over saturated and shopping opportunities slowed down. I started feeling like I wasn't getting anywhere in life while the people around me were getting amazing jobs, pursuing lofty educations, and just flat out getting way luckier than me. I felt myself slipping through the cracks. I thought I had wasted my potential. I really felt the thud of hitting the emotional bottom, watching the cloud of sand billowing out around me on the floor of an endless, empty ocean. 
                        </p>
                        <p>However, the hope you have at the bottom is the floor itself; a foundation for propulsion. The only thing I had left down there was myself, who I did not see until I was stripped of every worthless thing I had tried to cover up with. They say you don't know who you really are until you look into the void. Your possessions, your accomplishments, your money, your relationships, your reputation, your family...none of this matters to the void because you are completely and utterly alone. This is not a metaphor for me being suicidal, only a metaphor for the lack of identity I was experiencing. I had never been forced to look at myself in a vacuum. While I had some idea of who I was before this, there was no denying it now. Why was I so afraid of the truth? I realize now that my values and standards that I had refused to let go of had been forced upon me. Those values did not approve of the person I wanted to be deep down, and this destroyed my self-worth. So I sought to bury the real me until I couldn't hear her anymore. The problem is you can't actually bury the real you. That person will always be there, trying as hard to get out as you are to hide them.
                        </p>
                        <p>So now there was nothing to bury me with, and the only thing I could do was start doing, well...exactly what I wanted. It was hard at first. I wasn't totally sure I could think or say exactly what I wanted without the NSA coming after me or melting into a puddle on the floor. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I wasn't even one hundred percent sure it was what I wanted, but then when I started I didn't want to stop. It felt sinful to be happy, it felt like a guilty pleasure, but no one tried to stop me. People had some questions, sure, but I usually had an answer, and if I didn't have an answer no one seemed to care. I know this sounds like a coming out story, but really all I was doing was sewing and making videos about it. It was like everyone all at once gaslit me into thinking they had wanted this for me the whole time. It was very strange; maybe I had accidently been transported to an alternate dimension. It didn't matter anymore, all that mattered was I was finally free and happy and it didn't matter what anyone said about it. It didn't matter that we were in a pandemic, it didn't matter that I wasn't using my degree, it didn't matter that I wasn't making any money, it didn't matter what anyone thought, I just wanted to create. For once, what I wanted was enough. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Choosing myself has led to more exciting opportunities and discoveries in less than one year than I ever thought possible. It's almost like it's way easier being yourself than being anyone else. I've finally stopped beating myself up for failures. I'm actually more productive. I'm proud of myself for learning small things. I'm more resourceful. I say exactly what I think. I don't get embarrassed when I cry anymore. I get more compliments from people now because I think people see the happiness and confidence just overflowing. Every aspect of my life feels easier because I'm finally living for myself. 
                        </p>
                        <p>I hope you do the same. Part of my life's purpose is to inspire and encourage others to be themselves without fear. We need more happy people on this planet!!
                        </p>
